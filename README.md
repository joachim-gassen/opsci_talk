## A Talk on Open Science (in Business Economics Research)

### Welcome! 

This repository contains the materials for a talk that I (Joachim 
Gassen, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin and 
[TRR 266 "Accounting for Transparency"](https://www.accounting-for-transparency.de))
have given at the [2020 VHB Conference](https://www.bwl2020.org).

The talk discusses open science related issues and presents a case-study based
open science workflow using a containerized R/RStudio environment. It was 
delivered online as the "offline conference" was canceled due to the COVID-19 
outbreak. 


### TL;DNR

if you are simply looking for the slide deck, it is in the `slides` directory ;-)


### About the repository

In this repo, you will find

-	The code to generate the slides and the slides themselves (`slides`)
- Code for a case study that I use in the talk (`code`). The case study
re-investigates the link between national income and life expectancy
- A docker Makefile that allows you to quickly reproduce all the material 
and analysis contained in the code in a docker container (`docker`).
- Some raw data that the case uses (`raw_data`)
- An empty directory where the code stores data (`data`)


### Reproduce the material of the talk

First you need install docker. When you have
new version of MacOS or Windows 10 Professional/Enterprise installed: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/. **Read the introductions
for your operating system.** They are important.

If you happen to have an older/less expensive version of Windows then docker 
toolbox is your choice: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/. 
**Read the introductions for your operating system.** They are important.

After installing docker, the quickest way to reproduce the talk is to issue
the following command in your shell/terminal/cmd box. NOTE: Please change
`yourpass` to a meaningful password.

`docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=yourpass --name opsci joegassen/opsci_talk`

This will download the docker container and start it up. Alternatively, you can
also build the docker container from scratch using the Dockerfile in the `docker`
directory. Read it for further instructions.

After the docker container has started, use your favorite web browser and
point it to: `https://localhost:8787`. Log in with user 'rstudio' and your 
password from above. Select the "Build" tab in the top right window. 
Hit "Build all"

Enjoy!
